boilerplate_app-PHP-REST-JSON-MySQL
===================================

Starting point for a PHP driven app using ReST API, JSON and MySQL

Can use this as a backend 'process.php' for handling AJAX requests from jQuery etc, 
you can include handler functions/classes from a seperate file and just use this as a ReST router also.

Error logging enabled by default, MySQL PDO query method and some conveinence functions for JSON output in the app.
